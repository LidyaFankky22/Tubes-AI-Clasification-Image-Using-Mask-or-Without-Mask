# Tubes AI ~ Face Mask Detection Using Transfer Learning
## About Dataset
In the preparation of this project using 2 datasets from the same source. This dataset is obtained from [Github.com](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiments/) This dataset is used for Face Mask Detection Classification with an image consisting of almost 1700 images. With directory details:
  1. Test :
     * WithMask : 97 images
     * WithoutMask : 97 images
  2. Train :
     * WithMask : 690 images
     * WithoutMask : 686 images
  3. Validation :
     * WithMask : 71 images
     * WithoutMask : 71 images
## Deep Learning Techniques
